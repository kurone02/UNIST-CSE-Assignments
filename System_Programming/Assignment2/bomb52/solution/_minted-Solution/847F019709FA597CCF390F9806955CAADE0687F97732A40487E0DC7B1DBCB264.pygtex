  Welcome to my fiendish little bomb. You have \PYG{l+m}{6} phases with
  which to blow yourself up. Have a nice day!
  Verbosity leads to unclear, inarticulate things.
  Phase \PYG{l+m}{1} defused. How about the next one?
  \PYG{l+m}{0} \PYG{l+m}{1} \PYG{l+m}{3} \PYG{l+m}{6} \PYG{l+m}{10} \PYG{l+m}{15}
  That\PYG{err}{\PYGZsq{}}s number \PYG{l+m}{2}.  Keep going!
